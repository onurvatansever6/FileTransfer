# How to build release in Android
1) Change your terminals directory to android folder.
```
 cd .\android\
```
2) Generate a keystore.
You will need a Java generated signing key which is a keystore file used to generate a React Native executable binary for Android. You can change the names if you want. You can create one using the keytool in the terminal with the following command

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_key_name.keystore -alias your_key_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

3) If "gradlew assembleRelease" does not work use this instead: 
```
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
4) Release apk will be in your "android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk" folder
